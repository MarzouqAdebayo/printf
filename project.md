# PRINTF Project Board
## Background

 - **_printf.c** - This file contains the main `printf.c` function which processes the function arguments and passes them to the appropriate `print` function.
 - **main.h** - Contains all structures declaration and function prototypes
 - **_putchar.c** - This function mimics the `putchar` function of the stdio library.
 - **print_string.c** - This file takes strings and prints them to stdout using `_putchar` function from `_putchar.c`

## To-Do
### Task 0
#### N:B - If a to-do is done, kindly delete it from this list. Also, add to the list if there is a task to do.

 1. Take care of edge cases such as `"% s"`  or passing a specifier without an argument.
